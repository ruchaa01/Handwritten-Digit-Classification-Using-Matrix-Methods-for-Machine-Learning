Use of inner products for classifying handwritten digits


# 2. Hand-written Digit Classification using Feature-based Linear Regression : 
Classifying handwritten digits using linear regression based on "hand crafted" features.

 # 4. Handwritten Digit Classification using Logistic Regression :
Use of three classification methods: subspace-based classification, least-squares based classification, and logistic regression classification (least-squares and logistic are both regression-type classifiers) for classifying handwritten digits.
